# Autoencoder_MNIST
Autoencoder Model for Image Dimension Reduction

The dataset used is Fashion MNIST. 

In this project, an autoencoder model is developed to reduce dimensions from 784 (28x28) to 128. 

The quality of the reconstructed images is evaluated using the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) on the test data.
